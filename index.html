        <p>Hello I'm Abraham. I work at the Fred Meyers currently as produce clerk I am planning to start a new job with Seattle Childrens Hospital as a security guard. I'm in the program in hopes that I will learn new things and get a better understanding of the material we are learning and anything I knew before this course, I hope it will be able to give me a boost towards my goal of getting a degree in cybersecurty. Some activities I enjoy are watching Anime some of the current animes I am watching are The rising of the shield hero, black clover, one piece, that time I got reincarnated as a slime. I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, simming, fishing, camping, playing sports. I also enjoy playing video games some games I been playing are apex legends, resident evil 2, doom, rage 2. </p>
